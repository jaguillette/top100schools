# top100schools
Here I have some data from [Niche](https://k12.niche.com/rankings/public-high-schools/best-overall/) on high school quality rankings, as well as the notebook I used to generate the data.  

If you have an Anaconda Python distribution (I used Python 3, but I think it'll work on 2.7), the notebook should run no problem, and you'll be able to generate csvs from the rankings for other areas from Niche.  

Overall, it's a pretty neat dataset that they generated, I just wanted to get a different look at it.
